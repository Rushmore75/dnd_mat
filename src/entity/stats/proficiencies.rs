/* 
Could all these be in a mod to make generics easier? (shorter)

The #[derive(xyz)] are there basically as bounds for generics so
methods don't freak out. They wouldn't be needed if it wasn't
abstracted like this as methods would implicitly see that they are
good to go. 

"Nothing really stops me from making these just lists of strings"
This removes "magic values" from being needed. You can later pass
an enum value to the hashmap to retrieve values instead of strings.
Makes cleaner code in practice.
